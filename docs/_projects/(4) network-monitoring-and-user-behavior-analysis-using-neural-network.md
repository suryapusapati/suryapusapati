# Network Monitoring and User Behavior Analysis using Neural Network
## Highlights
- Developed two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers to predict network KPIs using IP traffic dataset
- In Network Monitoring: Deep ANN predicts recently visited website
- In User Behavior: Deep ANN classifies the level of traffic consumption
- Improved the data quality using data manipulation methods in Pandas and NumPy
- In comparison, the developed Deep ANN classifiers out-performed other Machine Learning algorithms
