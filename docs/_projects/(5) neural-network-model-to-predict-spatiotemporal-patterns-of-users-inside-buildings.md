# Neural Network Model to Predict Spatiotemporal Patterns of users inside Buildings

![overview of the project](/files/indoor_positioning_scatter_plot.JPG)

## Highlights
- Developed an ANN algorithm called MLP to predict spatiotemporal patterns of mobile device of user such as 
location of mobile device, type of mobile device, and time
- Prepared the dataset for training of MLP model by using ETL methods
- The performance of the indoor positioning MLP model outperformed other start-of-art Machine Learning algorithms in the literature
